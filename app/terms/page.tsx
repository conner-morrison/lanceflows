              relationship stays structured and predictable.

                These Terms of Service (&quot;Terms&quot;) govern your access to and use of the
                Lanceflows website and the software engineering, applied&nbsp;AI, automation, and
                cloud services we provide (&quot;Services&quot;). By using this site or engaging us,
                you agree to these Terms. Specific projects are also governed by a separate written
                agreement, proposal, or statement of work (&quot;Project Agreement&quot;), which
                prevails where it differs from these Terms.

                client ideas into reliable products through clear architecture, disciplined
                execution, transparent milestones, and long-term scalability planning. References to
                &quot;we,&quot; &quot;us,&quot; and &quot;our&quot; mean Lanceflows; &quot;you&quot;
                means the individual or organization using the site or engaging our Services.
              </p>

              <h2>2. Use of the Website</h2>
              <p>You may use this website for lawful, informational, and business purposes. You agree not to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Use the site in any way that breaches applicable law or regulation.</li>
                <li>
                  Attempt to gain unauthorized access to, disrupt, or impair the site or its
                  underlying systems.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Copy, scrape, or redistribute site content except as permitted by these Terms or
                  with our written consent.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h2>3. Our Services</h2>
              <p>
                Our Services may include product engineering, AI and automation, cloud and DevOps,
                data and integration, architecture and consulting, and ongoing maintenance and
                growth. We typically work through one of several engagement models:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Dedicated development team for long-term product delivery.</li>
                <li>Fixed-scope project delivery for clearly defined outcomes.</li>
                <li>Staff augmentation for engineering capacity and specialist support.</li>
                <li>Technical consulting and architecture review.</li>
                <li>Ongoing maintenance, optimization, and product support.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The precise scope, deliverables, timeline, and fees for any engagement are defined in
                the applicable Project Agreement.
              </p>

              <h2>4. Proposals, Quotes, and Estimates</h2>
              <p>
                Information on this site, and any quote or estimate we provide, is for general
                guidance and does not constitute a binding offer. A binding engagement is formed only
                when both parties accept a written Project Agreement.
              </p>

              <h2>5. Client Responsibilities</h2>
              <p>Reliable delivery depends on a reliable partnership. You agree to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Provide accurate, complete, and timely information, access, and approvals needed
                  for the work.
                </li>
                <li>Designate a responsive point of contact for decisions and feedback.</li>
                <li>
                  Ensure you have the rights to any materials, data, or third-party assets you
                  provide to us.
                </li>
                <li>Meet agreed payment terms and milestone obligations.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Delays or incomplete information from your side may affect timelines and delivery, as
                reflected in the Project Agreement.
              </p>

              <h2>6. Fees and Payment</h2>
              <p>
                Fees, billing schedules, and currencies are set out in the applicable Project
                Agreement. Unless stated otherwise, invoices are due within the period specified in
                that agreement. Late or missed payments may result in suspension of work. Fees are
                exclusive of any applicable taxes, which are your responsibility.
              </p>

              <h2>7. Intellectual Property and Deliverables</h2>
              <p>
                Subject to full payment and the terms of the applicable Project Agreement, final
                deliverables created specifically for you transfer to you on the agreed terms. We
                retain ownership of our pre-existing tools, frameworks, know-how, and reusable
                components, and may grant you a license to use them as part of the deliverables.
                Third-party and open-source components remain governed by their respective licenses.
                Both parties retain ownership of their respective pre-existing materials.
              </p>

              <h2>8. Confidentiality</h2>
              <p>
                Each party may receive confidential information from the other in the course of an
                engagement. Both parties agree to protect such information, use it only to perform or
                receive the Services, and not disclose it to third parties except as needed to
                deliver the work or as required by law.
              </p>

              <h2>9. Acceptable Use of Delivered Systems</h2>
              <p>
                Software, AI systems, and automations we build are intended to be used lawfully and
                as designed. You are responsible for how delivered systems are configured, operated,
                and used in production after handover, including any data processed through them.
              </p>

              <h2>10. Warranties and Disclaimers</h2>
              <p>
                We perform Services with senior engineering judgment and professional care. Except as
                expressly stated in a Project Agreement, the website and Services are provided
                &quot;as is&quot; and &quot;as available,&quot; without warranties of any kind,
                whether express or implied, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness
                for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. We do not warrant that the site or
                any system will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free of all vulnerabilities.
              </p>

              <h2>11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
              <p>
                To the maximum extent permitted by law, Lanceflows will not be liable for any
                indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or for lost
                profits, revenue, data, or goodwill, arising out of or related to the site or
                Services. Our total aggregate liability arising from an engagement will not exceed the
                fees paid to us for that engagement during the period giving rise to the claim, except
                where the applicable Project Agreement states otherwise.
              </p>

              <h2>12. Third-Party Services</h2>
              <p>
                Our Services and the systems we build may rely on third-party platforms and providers
                (for example, cloud, hosting, and integration tools). We are not responsible for the
                availability, performance, or terms of those third-party services, which are governed
                by their own agreements.
              </p>

              <h2>13. Term and Termination</h2>
              <p>
                These Terms apply while you use the website. Engagements may be terminated as set out
                in the applicable Project Agreement. On termination, you remain responsible for fees
                for work performed up to the effective date, and provisions that by their nature
                should survive — including confidentiality, intellectual property, disclaimers, and
                limitation of liability — will continue to apply.
              </p>

              <h2>14. Changes to These Terms</h2>
              <p>
                We may update these Terms from time to time. When we do, we will revise the
                &quot;Last updated&quot; date above. Your continued use of the website after changes
                take effect constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
              </p>

              <h2>15. Governing Law</h2>
              <p>
                These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which Lanceflows
                operates, without regard to conflict-of-law principles, unless a Project Agreement
                specifies otherwise.
              </p>
